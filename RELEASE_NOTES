Release Notes for DCube
=======================

0.7 June 3, 2010
----------------

- Fixed a bug that allowed queries in one database to cross into another
  database.  This condition was obviously really bad for data integrity and the
  logical separation of the shared datastore.

- Added the ability to do range queries using the `<=>` operator. A range
  query is kind of like the 'like' query used for partial string matching in
  relational database systems. In DCube it is `property >= query_param
  AND property < ufffd` where ufffd is the largest possible unicode character

0.6 APR 6, 2010
---------------

- A bug in the /users/ URL handler prevented an authenticated user with the
  proper credentials from accessing the full scope of another user object.
  This is a big enough change in the public HTTP API that it warrents this new
  minor version number.

0.5.1 MAR 4, 2010
-----------------

- Fixed a bug causing an HTTP 500 server error in the databases/ URL.


0.5 FEB 25, 2010
----------------

- Fixed a couple JSONRequest protocol incompatabilities. This implementation
  now accepts "application/jsonrequest: extension" style HTTP header notation,
  and also returns JSONRequest errors as JSON text instead of plain text.


0.4 Feb 10, 2010
----------------

- This release marks the first, fully funtional milestone.

- Re-implemented the HTTP handling on top of the GAE provided WebApp framework,
  which is based on WebOb. The functional programming experiment was going
  well, but I decided that I would rather have a base line performance metrics
  measured against the provided framework.  After using the program enough to
  gain some level of confidence in its correctness, then we can tear apart the
  framework, looking for optimizations.

- Added full DCube query functionality using the JSONRrequest protocol.


0.3 Jan 29, 2010
----------------

- Removed the the smoke and mirrors proxy interface to the App Engine datastore
  and left the security issues up to the handler functions. This reduced the
  complexity of the overall program, but made attention to data security in the
  handler functions imperative.

- Removed the session handling object/module and the WebOb dependency. This was
  done in large part to attempt a more functional programming idiom.

- Refactored the automating testing to be more explicit.

- Full DCube user management functionality using the JSONRequest protocol.

- Full DCube database management functionality using the JSONRequest protocol.


0.1 Jan 4, 2010
---------------

- A robots.txt file in the main domain to inform bots that they may not want to
  crawl this domain.

- A handler for the /environs URL that simply prints a list of all the
  environment variables.

- A proxy interface to the App Engine datastore based on the principles of
  users and groups in Unix file systems. This interface limits access to
  persisted data in the datastore through a system of smoke and mirrors that does
  not enforce security policy, but rather, it avoids insecure programming
  mistakes and organizes the code for better comrehension.

- A factory module (factory.py) that builds privileged interfaces to the
  datastore.

- A gate module (gate.py) that manages access to the datastore interface
  factory using a YAML configuration file.

- Advanced challenge response authentication
  (http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/advancedauth.html#alternative) through the
  pychap.py helper module.

- A wsgi *like* request/response session handler that uses parts of the webob
  module to remove most of the work of handling the special brand of
  JSONRequest (http://www.json.org/JSONRequest.html) that this implementation
  uses.

- A *mostly* coverage automated test suite using the unittest module.
