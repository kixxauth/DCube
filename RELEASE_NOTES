Release Notes for DCube
=======================

0.3 Jan 29, 2010
----------------

- Removed the the smoke and mirrors proxy interface to the App Engine datastore
  and left the security issues up to the handler functions. This reduced the
  complexity of the overall program, but made attention to data security in the
  handler functions imperative.

- Removed the session handling object/module and the WebOb dependency. This was
  done in large part to attempt a more functional programming idiom.

- Refactored the automating testing to be more explicit.

- Full DCube user management functionality using the JSONRequest protocol.

- Full DCube database management functionality using the JSONRequest protocol.


0.1 Jan 4, 2010
---------------

- A robots.txt file in the main domain to inform bots that they may not want to
  crawl this domain.

- A handler for the /environs URL that simply prints a list of all the
  environment variables.

- A proxy interface to the App Engine datastore based on the principles of
  users and groups in Unix file systems. This interface limits access to
  persisted data in the datastore through a system of smoke and mirrors that does
  not enforce security policy, but rather, it avoids insecure programming
  mistakes and organizes the code for better comrehension.

- A factory module (factory.py) that builds privileged interfaces to the
  datastore.

- A gate module (gate.py) that manages access to the datastore interface
  factory using a YAML configuration file.

- Advanced challenge response authentication
  (http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/advancedauth.html#alternative) through the
  pychap.py helper module.

- A wsgi *like* request/response session handler that uses parts of the webob
  module to remove most of the work of handling the special brand of
  JSONRequest (http://www.json.org/JSONRequest.html) that this implementation
  uses.

- A *mostly* coverage automated test suite using the unittest module.
