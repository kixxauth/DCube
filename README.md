DCube for Google App Engine
===========================

DCube is a high level distributed data store protocol designed to be
implemented on platform services like Google App Engine and Amazon Web
Services.

This software is a prototype implementation used to explore the possibilities
of distributed data store functionality. It is built on open web protocols,
architecture, and technologies like HTTP and JSON. It draws influence from
[Representational State Transfer][2], RDF, the semantic web, and related
concepts.

In effect, this particular implementation of the DCube concept exposes a
[JSONRequest][3] API that gives users access to the Google Appengine
distrubuted datastore.

### This DCube host is implemented in Python on Google App Engine service platform.

### DCube is sponsored by [The Fireworks Project](http://www.fireworksproject.com).
