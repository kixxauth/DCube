DCube for Google App Engine
===========================

DCube is a high level distributed data store protocol. It is designed to be
implemented on platform services like Google App Engine and Amazon Web
Services. It is built on open web protocols, architecture, and technologies
like HTTP and JSON. It draws influence from [Representational State
Transfer][2], [RDF][1], the semantic web, and related concepts.

This program is a prototype implementation of the DCube protocol used to
explore the possibilities of distributed data store functionality.
Specifically it exposes a [JSONRequest][3] API that gives users access to the
Google App Engine data store.
