DCube for Google App Engine
===========================

DCube is a high level distributed data store that is designed to be implemented
on platform services like Google App Engine and Amazon Web Services.

This software is a prototype implementation used to explore the possibilities
of distributed data store functionality. It is built on open web protocols,
architecture, and technologies like like HTTP and JSON. It draws influence from
[Representational State Transfer][2], RDF, the semantic web, and some related
concepts.

In effect, this particulary implementation of the DCube concept exposes a
[JSONRequest][3] API that gives users access to the Google App Engine
distrubuted datastore.

### This DCube host is implemented in Python on Google App Engine service platform.

### DCube is sponsored by [The Fireworks Project](http://www.fireworksproject.com).
